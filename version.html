    </h1>
    <ul><li>Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code. </li><li>Using it, the developers can work together on code and separate their tasks through branches.</li>

      <li>There can be several branches in a version control system, according to the number of collaborators. The branches maintain individuality as the code changes remain in a specified branch(s).</li>
        <li>Developers can combine the code changes when required. Further, they can view the history of changes, go back to the previous version(s) and use/manage code in the desired fashion.

        </li>
        <p>Git commit command is the main function for saving changes to local repository safely. Commit takes a snapshot of the project and treats it as a version content.

        <li>Git <strong><i style="color:#a6443d;">fork</i></strong></li>
            <p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>
        <li>Git <strong><i style="color:#a6443d;">push</i></strong></li>
            <p>
                The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub. The command used for pushing to GitHub is- git push 'remote_name' 'branch_name'
